My project involves data manipulation and analysis using Excel, focusing on transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Key highlights include:

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Formulas and Functions: Used Excel formulas (e.g., VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIF) to perform calculations, automate tasks, and derive insights.

Pivot Tables: Created dynamic pivot tables to summarize data, analyze trends, and generate actionable reports.

Charts and Visualizations: Designed charts (e.g., bar, line, pie) to represent data trends and comparisons visually.

Tables: Structured the data into formatted tables for better readability, filtering, and sorting.

The project demonstrates proficiency in Excel for data analysis, ensuring efficient processing and insightful reporting
